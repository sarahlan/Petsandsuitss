            Pets and Suits started of as a way to have a friend. We originally had a friend that wanted to be able to communicate with her dog. 
            She lived by herself and just wanted a buddy. For her birthday we created a suit for her dog to be able to interact with her and she loved it! 
            Later on she also mentioned that she  wanted to be able to talk to her dog so we created a translator device so she would be able to communicate with him. 
            Our translator device translates what your animal says into english. The device looks like a little boom box in the suit. That is how Pets and Suits was born. 
            With our suits your pet can now interact with you as a friend would. Our suits are designed to a size of 5ft tall. It also has all four limbs and can assist your dog with anything. 
            You can talk to them and play with them! With our suits there is a built in pet translator that can help you communicate with your pet. It can be adjusted to any language you like. 
            We have so many different options of suits for dogs, cat, fish, monkey and bunny.
